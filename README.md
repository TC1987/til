TIL is a blog that was created to allow users to post whatever they'd like about programming/tech. Both frontend and backend is powered by Javascript (you know, the best language ever :D).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

```
1. Clone or download this project.
2. Navigate your way to the project directory.
3. Type 'npm i'.
4. Type 'npm start'.
5. Your browser should automatically open but if it doesn't, make your way to http://localhost:3000
6. Select an algorithm on the left, click 'Start' and gaze in amazement.
```

### Prerequisites

Got Node? If so, you're golden! If not, grab it here [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). You'll need it for 'npm' which is used to install the project's dependencies and execute the 'start' script.

## Running Tests

Tests can be run with 'npm test'.
